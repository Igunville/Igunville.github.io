		<h1><strong>How to navigate the terminal and vim</strong></h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Basic navigation in the terminal</h2>
	<p> The first step to navigating the terminal is to know where you can go. You can do this by typing in <strong><kbd>ls</kbd></strong>. This will show you where you can go. When you decide where to go you will type in <strong><kbd>cd</kbd></strong> followed by a space and where you want to go. For example you could say <strong><kbd>cd desktop</kbd></strong> and it would take you to your desktop. Once you are there you cna follow the same steps to go even farther in. If you want to return to the last place that you were you can use <strong><kbd>cd ..</kbd></strong> this can take you back as far as you can go. Using these command you should be able to naigate around the termainal.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>ls</strong> to see where you can go</li>
			<li><strong>cd</strong> to go into a new directory</li>
			<li><strong>cd ..</strong> to go back</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Making files and folders</h2>
		<p> Now lets talk about making new folders and files. To make a new folder use the <strong><kbd>mkdir</kbd></strong> if you use this followed by the name that you want the folder to be named it will create a new one in the foler you are in. For example <strong><kbd>mkdir website</kbd></strong> this will make a new folder called website. If you want to make a new file you cna use the <strong><kbd>echo</kbd></strong> command followed by what you want it to say in the file and the file name. For example <strong><kbd>echo "hello" >> index.html</kbd></strong> this will make a new file called index.html and will write hello in it.<p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>mkdir</strong> to make a new folder</li>
			<li><strong>echo</strong> to make a new file</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
		<h2>Vim</h2>
		<p>Finally we will talk about how to use vim. To enter it use <strong><kbd>vim</kbd></strong> followed by the file name. For example <strong><kbd>vim index.html</kbd></strong> will put you in the file index.html in vim. You will notice when you enter vim that you can not use your cursor. You can navigate using the <strong>h,i,j,k</strong> <strong>h</strong> will move your cursor left. Next <strong>i</strong> will move your cursor right, <strong>j</strong> will move your cursor down and finally <strong>k</strong> will move your cursor up. When you enter vim you will be in normal mode. You can use <strong>i</strong> or <strong>a</strong> to enter insert mode. In insert mode you can type and edit the file. When you are done editing you can use the <strong><kbd>esc</kbd></strong> key to exit back into normal mode. If you wan to quit you can use <strong><kbd>:q</kbd></strong> this will quit without saving. If you do <strong><kbd>:wq</kbd></strong> this will quit and save. If you just want to save and not quit you use <strong><kbd>:w</kbd></strong>.</p>
	
	<ul>
			<li><strong>:q</strong> to quit</li>
			<li><strong>:wq</strong> to quit and save</li>
			<li><strong>:w</strong> to save and not quti</li>
		</ul>

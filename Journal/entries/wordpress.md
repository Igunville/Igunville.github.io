# reflection
I noticed that while I was looking at custom ink and other similar custom printing websites that they all included a pricing page for their most basic shirts. The other more expensive shirts you could find but were not as hugely advertised. I think that is because these are their most popular products and will be what most people are looking for.

I liked wordpress. It was very simple to use and pretty easy to figure out. I did not like how you had to use certain element and there were some things you couldn't change. You were very limited to what it wanted you to make.

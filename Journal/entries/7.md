#Ai and Coding
I laerned many things about github and ai on this project. Ai is very good at makign basic code and makes it very quickly. As you start to polish up on the game or webstie it gets mcuh harder to make it do what you want in the way that you want. It became very frusturating as I continued working on it. I think that it is a very helpful tool but can not write the website 100% for you. If it were to actually use it to maek a website I would go back over the code and make sure that everythign worked and looked good. While I was making this I wanted to remake wordle which I did for my javascript game project however copilot really strguged to make the game playable. In the end I transfered to snake and it made the game realatively well.

<p>My family loves this recipe around the holidays, especially thanksgiving. This apple pie is incredibly delicious. The crumble on top is perfect for a differetn textuare. The melted ice cream in the mix helps the apples stay moist and adds flavor. My family loves this recipe they say <q>I don tusually like apple pie but this is delicious</q> they also say <q>This is the best apple pie ever</q>. IT can be made with a store bought crust but it is better with a home made one. Pretty much any crust will work with this pie.</p>

<h3>Tips and tricks to make this recipe good</h3>
<hr>
<ul>	
	<li>Use the melted ice cream, it may sound weird but it works very weel and keeps the apples moist</li>
	<li>Use a squirt of lemon juice to keep the apples fresh, this also balnaces out some of the sweetness</li>
	<li>The crumble will solidify in the fridge make sure to break it up into small chunks before putting it on the pie</li>
	<li>It does not matter what apples you use but for a balance use some granny smith and some pink lady</li>
	<li>Serve with vannilla or cinnamon ice cream</li>
	<li>Do not put the juices from the apples into the pie becuase it will make the crust soggy</li>
</ul>

			<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>First cut and core all of your apples. You wan them to be in 1/4 inch slices. Toss them in a bowl with the ice cream, cinnamon, sugar and salt. In addtion to this a squirt of lemon jiuce will help them stay fresh if you are nto making the pie for a while. make sure that all the apples are evenly coated. Let this sit for 1 hour.</li>
			
			<li>While the apples are sitting Roll out your dough ansuring that you have at least a 12 inch circle. Carefully transfer your dough to the pie dish and cut off any excess dough hanging over the sides. Flute the edges of the crust by squezing it between your index, pointer and middle finger. Refriderate until the apples have sat for an hour.</li>
			
			<li>Next combine all of the ingredients for your streusel topping and mix until everything is combined. Put it in a bowl and refridgerate for at least 20 minutes. Once there are 10 minutes left on your timer preheat your oven to 350.</li>
			
			<li>Once everything is ready put the apples in the pie crust and layer the stuesel on top of the apples. Make sure nto to pile the apples in the middle or else it will cook unevenly. Put it in the oven and bake it for 45-60 minutes. Flip it half way through the baking time. To make sure it is done insert a knife in to the center and if it pierces the apples easily then it is done. Make sure the stuersel has browned.</li>
			<li>Let the pie cool for at least 4 hours overnight is better. This will help everyting solidify and make it easier to cut. This also helps everything stay together!</li>
